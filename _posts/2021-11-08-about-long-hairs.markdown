I finally got a haircut after almost 2 years a few days back. I have been getting a new haircut for the new year for the last decade or more. But since covid lockdowns in 2020 I hadn't gotten a haircut. This changed last week when my vaccination status changed to vaccinated thereby complying with the orders of the land.

Anyhow, I wanted to document some of the changes that long hair brings;

- Everything has hairs! The longer the hair the more it falls because of the lack of lubrication/oil somewhere making the hairs get into knots. The worst for me was the act of cleaning the bathroom sinkhole. As someone who has developed a cleanliness bug, this was way too annoying. The worst part was when I had to travel and do it in the bathrooms of my friends.

- Loss of time. My showers typically take 2-5 minutes. But for the 20 months or so it took over 20 minutes. Why? As you have to use so much product to make the hair just be untangled! You have to shampoo, use conditioner, oil, serum etc. etc. The list is endless.

### This reminds me to ask; WHAT HAPPENED TO SHAMPOO + CONDITIONERS?

This is what we used to have until a few years back, when were they driven out of the market doubling our hair care time! Of all the things that could have been cancelled, this definitely didn't deserve to.

- Headaches. Not sure how much of it is directly linked to the longer hairs but I had a more relaxed forehead and no aches there post the haircut. I realized I used to pull my hair too much before tieing it up, could that be the reason?

Overall, I am happy I am back to short hairs and hopefully will never return to long hairs!
