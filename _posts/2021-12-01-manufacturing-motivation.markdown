I am a pretty lazy person ðŸ¤ª. Always have been. However, I have never lacked the motivation to work and do my best throughout my career, until now.

I have also been financially secure for most of my career and am now more than ever. I blame it on the Covid related lockdowns.

The lack of motivation to work is preventing me from starting something new, joining a company or just being able to think about products. I find the situation unsettling and want to get out of it. What is life without your life's work?

As an experiment to try and motivate me, I am planning to get rid of as much liquid cash as possible into assets that are slow to liquify. Maybe a bank balance in low digits may motivate me to get back on my horse. ðŸ¤ž
