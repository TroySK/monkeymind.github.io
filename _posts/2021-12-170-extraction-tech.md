1. Break your stuff into small parts.
2. You may use a grinder but do not let it become mostly powder.
3. Get some ethanol and pour it into your stuff. The cooler the ethanol the better it is as you will avoid water being absorbed from your stuff.
4. Shake for 3 minutes.
5. Use a filter paper and collect the filtered liquid.
6. Repeat 2/3 times with the same material to get all of the stuff out.

This mix contains your stuff and ethanol. The goal now is to get rid of the ethanol.

7. You may boil the solution at 70C or in a water bath so ethanol evaporates.

Else you can use the distillation unit to recover the ethanol rather than losing it to the atmosphere.
There is also a better processes like the soxhlet method for you to explore.
