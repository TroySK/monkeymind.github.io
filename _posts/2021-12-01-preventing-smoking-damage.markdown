Smoking is one of the activities which humans have enjoyed for thousands of years. Educating the public with knowledge about the harms of smoking, primarily smoking tobacco doesn't seem to have worked.

I have had my fair share of smokes and have seen many suffer late in their life because of smoking. I plan to not suffer from the same consequences.

Based on my reading and advice from friends (who are doctors), I am trying some tools and techniques to reduce the damage done by smoking.

1. Using a nebulizer every day. Helps clean up the lungs.
2. Using COPD/asthma relieving inhaler. I use Foracort's Synchrobreathe as it's easy to use.
3. Using a statin on a regular basis to control the cholesterol and in turn pressure.

The result will only be clear after 10/20 years. I am not sure if I will be able to continue for that long.

Caring for your own health looks easy but turns out to be hard ðŸ¤ª.
