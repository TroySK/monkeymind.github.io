The best education I have had was the one at the job. I assume this is the norm in the tech world especially if you are working on products and technologies which are on the bleeding edge. However, we seldom share or can share our learnings because a similar context doesn't happen again or we move on to other problems. We should be sharing our knowledge gained during the crisis period so others can avoid such crises from arising in the future. As the world becomes more and more wired and 9 9s become the standard, such real-world problem solutions might be something everyone would be interested in.

I like postmortems and battle stories from production a lot! When I interview candidates, this is the question I am most excited about. It is awesome to collaborate with someone who is looking to join your team and we together discuss the #fail and try to find solutions that were used and which could have been used. Oh, the personal tricks engineers use, I am always in awe!

I wish there was a podcast where engineers discussed their worst nightmare situations and how they got out of it. That would be one of the greatest engineering courses in my book.
