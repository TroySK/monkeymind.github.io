I read about microdosing back in 2011-12. I had not given it much thought when I first came to know of it. Over the years, I got more intrigued as I read many more posts and articles. By 2015 I had convinced myself that there weren't any serious side-effects and would be a good experiment to try and see if it can enhance performance and endurance both mental and physical. I did the usual 1-day dose and 2-day break schedule. I continued the experiment for 3 years. After that, I travelled and didn't feel to need to take it.
As time passed I did other experiments using Holotropic Breathwork, Magnesium L-Theonate, Modafinil, Caffeine etc. and then the pandemic happened. It has been almost 2 years since our lives changed. And as I am deloading, I had been thinking of resuming microdosing for some time and it finally happened today.

I am not sure how much of it was a placebo effect but I certainly felt a bit different today. It's a weird feeling. ðŸ¥´
